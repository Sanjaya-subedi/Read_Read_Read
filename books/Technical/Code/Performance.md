1. The duration of a clock cycle is the reciprocal of the clock frequency; for a 1 GHz CPU, one clock cycle is 1 nanosecond (one billionth of a second).
2. Instruction time is the time CPU takes to execute one instruction (like add, load, store). It is measured in clock cycles per instruction. Instruction time is the product of the number of clock cycles an instruction requires and the duration of one clock cycle. Faster clocks reduce cycles time, but instruction complexity and pipeline deesign also determing overall speed.
3. Performance is not just about the CPU, memory is a huge factor. CPU executes instructions at clock cycle speed and memory access (reading/writing) can take many cycles - often slower than the CPU clock. So even if a CPU has a 1 ns clock cycle, fetching data from main memory (DRAM) might take 50-100 ns, meaning 50-100 CPU cycles.
4. Instruction performance depends not only on CPU clock cycles but also on memory latency; modern CPUs rely on caches to minimize the gap between fast computation and slower memory access.
