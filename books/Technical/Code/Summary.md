# THE Code – Summary

**Book:** Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software 
**Author:** Charles Petzold

Information ≠ electricity
Information = interpretation of signals


## WHY I READ THIS

As a software engineer with a Computer Science background, I wanted to deeply understand what lies beneath the abstractions we use every day. While we work with high-level languages, frameworks, and operating systems, all computation ultimately rests on simple physical and logical principles. This book helped bridge the gap between human ideas and machine execution by explaining how complex systems emerge from extremely simple building blocks.

This book strengthened my intuition about how software is grounded in hardware, and how hardware itself is built upon logic, signals, and physical constraints.

## SUMMARY

- **Communication Before Computers**
  The book begins with early communication systems such as Morse code, flashlights, and telegraphs. These examples show how information can be encoded using simple on/off signals. This establishes the idea that information does not need complexity—it needs consistency and interpretation.

- **Binary and Representation**
  Petzold introduces binary not as a mathematical abstraction, but as a natural consequence of reliable signal representation. Using switches, relays, and lamps, the book shows how numbers, letters, and symbols can be represented using combinations of two states.

- **Logic from Switches**
  Logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT are built from simple switches. These operations form the foundation of decision-making in machines. The book demonstrates how logic gates emerge naturally from physical constraints and electrical behavior.

- **Building Arithmetic from Logic**
  Using logic gates, the book constructs adders, subtractors, and eventually full arithmetic units. This section shows how arithmetic operations are not magical—they are structured combinations of simple logical rules applied repeatedly.

- **Memory and State**
  Memory is introduced as the ability of a system to remember previous states. Memory is introduced as the ability of a system to remember previous states by feeding its output back into its input, allowing the system to maintain a stable state even after the original input is removed. Using feedback loops and latches (A latch is a basic memory circuit that stores one bit by feeding its output back into its input, allowing it to retain its state until explicitly changed), the book explains how machines store bits, bytes, and eventually structured data.

- **From Hardware to Software**
  Once computation, memory, and control flow exist, the book transitions to machine code, instruction sets, and simple programming concepts. It explains how software is an abstraction layered on top of hardware, not something separate from it.

- **Abstraction as the Core Theme**
  Each layer—signals, logic, circuits, machine code, assembly, and higher-level languages—exists to manage complexity. The book emphasizes that abstraction does not remove complexity; it organizes it.

Overall, the book shows how modern computers are not mysterious machines, but logical extensions of very simple ideas applied systematically.
