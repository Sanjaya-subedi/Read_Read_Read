## Concepts

- Internet as a Political Artifact
  The Internet is not neutral technology. Its structure, governance, and control reflect political interests, power struggles, and historical circumstances.

- Cold War Influence on Technology
  Fear of centralized failure during nuclear war directly influenced decentralized network design. Technical decisions were shaped by geopolitical anxiety.

- ARPA and State-Funded Innovation
  Major breakthroughs in networking came from public funding, not private enterprise. Government investment enabled long-term research without immediate profit pressure.

- Packet Switching
  Data is broken into packets that travel independently through a network. This enables fault tolerance, efficient routing, and scalability, distinguishing the Internet from earlier communication systems.

- Decentralization vs Centralization
  Early Internet design favored decentralization, but modern Internet usage increasingly relies on centralized platforms (cloud providers, social networks, ISPs).

- Open Protocols and Interoperability
  TCP/IP and related protocols were open standards, allowing different systems to communicate freely. This openness was critical to the Internet’s rapid growth.

- Commercial Incentives and Platform Power
  The shift to advertising-driven business models reshaped the Internet, concentrating power in a few dominant corporations.

- Surveillance and Data Control
  Governments and corporations exploit Internet infrastructure for monitoring, data extraction, and behavioral influence, challenging privacy and freedom.

- Internet Governance
  Control over infrastructure, protocols, and data flows determines who has power online. Governance is fragmented across states, corporations, and technical bodies.

- The Internet’s Future as a Choice
  The book frames the future of the Internet as something society actively shapes—through policy, regulation, and resistance—rather than an inevitable technical outcome.
