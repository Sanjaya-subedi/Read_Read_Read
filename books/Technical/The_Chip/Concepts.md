WHAT CONCEPTS DID I LEARN / REVISE

- Flow of Electrons and Current Control
   - At the heart of computing is the movement of electrons through conductive materials.
   - Early computers used vacuum tubes to control electron flow for switching and amplification.
   - Transistors replaced tubes, allowing smaller, faster, more energy-efficient control of electron flow.
   - Key idea: Computing is fundamentally about controlling current to represent information (0s and 1s).

- Transistors
   - A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals.
   - Types:
     - Bipolar junction transistors (BJT) – current-controlled
     - Field-effect transistors (FET) – voltage-controlled
   - Transistors are the building blocks of modern circuits, enabling logic gates and memory.

- Logic Gates and Circuits
   - Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) are implemented via transistor arrangements.
   - Gates are digital abstractions built on physical electron flow.
   - Understanding gates helps in understanding how computations are performed at the hardware level.
   - Early ICs combined multiple gates into a single chip, which drastically reduced size and increased speed.

- Integrated Circuits (ICs)
   - Combine multiple transistors and their connections onto a single piece of silicon.
   - Early ICs were made of germanium (Kilby) or silicon (Noyce).
     - Miniaturization → more transistors per chip
     - Reliability → fewer soldered connections
     - Cost efficiency → scalable production
   - Introduced the idea of planar process (oxidation is a part of this) for layering transistors on silicon wafers.

- Planar Process
   - Developed at Fairchild (Noyce) for mass production of silicon chips.
   - Build transistors on a flat (planar) silicon surface using photolithography.
   - Allowed precise and scalable manufacturing, which is critical for Moore’s Law (this law is the prediction, not a physical law).
   - Enabled thousands of transistors on one chip instead of manually wiring discrete components.

- Materials Science
   - Germanium vs Silicon:
     - Germanium: easier to experiment with, but poor thermal stability.
     - Silicon: higher melting point, better for large-scale fabrication.
   - Material choice affects:
     - Reliability
     - Thermal performance
     - Production feasibility
   - This demonstrates how physics and material properties define computing limits.

- Memory Fundamentals
   - Chips led to new forms of storing information.
   - Early memory devices (flip-flops, magnetic cores) evolved into transistor-based RAM.
   - Shows that hardware and software evolution are interdependent: the memory hardware limits the kinds of programs you can efficiently run.

- Miniaturization and Scaling
   - Smaller transistors → faster switching → less energy consumption.
   - Conceptually, the idea of packing more functionality into less space is central to chip design.
   - Sets the stage for:
     - Moore’s Law
     - Modern CPUs, GPUs, and SoCs
     - Embedded systems

- Legacy Concepts
    - Transistors → Gates → ICs → Microchips → Modern CPUs/GPUs
    - Every modern digital system relies on controlling electrons in semiconductors.
    - Understanding these concepts strengthens intuition about:
      - Performance bottlenecks
      - Energy efficiency
      - Memory hierarchy
      - Hardware-software interplay
