Some observations made based on the people I work with, I met with:

1. Priorities change with time - When people are younger in their careers, competition, titles, growth, money, and recognition often feel like the most important goals. Over time, other things rise in importance - stability, family, health, peace of mind and meaningful work rather than “impressive” work. At that point, the ability to compete is still there — they’re still capable, intelligent, and driven — but they don’t feel the need to prove it anymore. Satisfaction becomes more valuable than chasing the next ladder.

2. Excellence vs Endless Climbing - There are two very different instincts in people - Breadth + Ambition and Depth + Mastery People who stay in one place/domain and become extraordinarily deep experts. They accumulate “institutional wisdom”, build long-term credibility, shape systems over years instead of chasing constant novelty and often become the “quiet backbone” of organizations. They become just excellent at it and this isn’t “settling.” It’s choosing mastery. Many of the most respected engineers, scientists, craftspeople, doctors, and professors fall into this category.

WISDOM changes EVERYTHING?!
